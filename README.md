# Power BI Dashboards - IPL, Sales, and COVID-19

## Overview

This project consists of three interactive Power BI dashboards developed to analyze and visualize data for different domains: the Indian Premier League (IPL), Sales, and COVID-19. These dashboards were created using Power BI, leveraging DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: Main tool for data visualization and report generation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for custom calculations and aggregations
- **Power Query**: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
- **Excel/CSV/SQL Database** (as applicable): Data sources for analysis

## Tasks and Dashboards

### Task 1: IPL Dashboard

**Objective**: Analyze the performance of teams and players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) over different seasons.

**Features:**

- Match-wise and season-wise analysis of teams and players
- Metrics for bowlers: Economy rate, bowling average
- Metrics for batsmen: Strike rate, runs per inning
- Top-performing players (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders)
- Win/loss records and trends across seasons
- Venue-based match statistics

**Visuals:**

- Bar chart for total wins by a team
- Bar chart for total wins by venue

**Filters:**

- Season
- Date
- Fixture

**Cards:**

- Total runs
- Total wickets

### Task 2: Sales Dashboard

**Objective**: Provide insights into sales performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior.

**Features:**

- Overall sales performance metrics
- Monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends
- Customer segmentation and top-performing products
- Regional sales distribution
- Revenue breakdown by product categories
- Profitability analysis and key business KPIs

**Slicers:**

- Year
- Product
- Country
- Segment

**Filters:**

- Date

**Visuals:**

- Pie chart - Discount by discount band
- Area chart - Track revenue, COGS, and profit over time
- Bar chart - Top 5 performing products

**KPI:**

- Total profit by date

**Cards:**

- Total sales
- Total profit
- Total COGS

**Table:**

- Top performing segments by profit

### Task 3: COVID-19 Dashboard

**Objective**: Track and analyze COVID-19 case trends, recoveries, and fatalities across different regions.

**Features:**

- Global and country-wise COVID-19 case trends
- Daily and cumulative case growth analysis
- Recovery and fatality rates
- Interactive filters for region-based insights

## Data Cleaning and Processing

- **Power Query** was used to clean raw data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging datasets.
- **DAX formulas** were implemented to calculate dynamic measures and KPIs such as total sales, moving averages, win percentages, and case fatality rates.

## Conclusion

These dashboards provide valuable insights into different domains by utilizing Power BIâ€™s interactive and dynamic visualization capabilities. The use of DAX and Power Query ensured efficient data handling and meaningful analysis.

For further improvements, additional datasets and real-time data integration can be incorporated to enhance dashboard accuracy and usability.
